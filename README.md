# Breakout clone

Most of this was done by following the tutorial in https://rvagamejams.com/learn2love/. The rest of the features were added by me. TODO:
- Scores / Hi-scores
- make second stage harder, up ball velo
- Particles?
- Sounds
- Change size of paddle to make game harder?
- Use bitmasks and binary numbers to detect collisions https://rvagamejams.com/learn2love/pages/02-16-binary-and-bitmasks.html.

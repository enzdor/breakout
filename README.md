# Breakout clone

Most of this was done by following the tutorial in https://rvagamejams.com/learn2love/. The rest of the features were added by me. TODO:

- Sounds
- change to cooler font
- Use bitmasks and binary numbers to detect collisions https://rvagamejams.com/learn2love/pages/02-16-binary-and-bitmasks.html.
